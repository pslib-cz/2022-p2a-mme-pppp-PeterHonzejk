# A set of templates for 2D/3D cutting
This project involves creating 2D and 3D stamps that are used for cutting and embossing motifs into various materials. Currently, two finished stamps are available: a trilobite and a femur bone.

## Photodocumentation
Here, you can find the photographs of the resulting physical outputs:

## Complete Component and Material Base
Here is a list of components and materials needed to produce the stamps:

- 3D printed model
- Filament for 3D printing
- Pointed knife or cutting tool
- Sandpapers of various grits

## Procedure
The following procedure describes the production of stamps:

1. **Preparation of 3D model:** Download the 3D stamp model from the [print files](https://github.com/pslib-cz/2022-p2a-mme-pppp-PeterHonzejk/tree/main/sobory%20na%20tisk) folder with the .stl extension. Review the model in your chosen 3D printing software. Check if all the details of the model are correctly displayed.
2. **Setting up the 3D printer:** Turn on the 3D printer and check if it is correctly set up. Make sure the print bed is clean and flat, and the print head is properly aligned.
3. **Selection and preparation of filament:** Choose filament in a suitable color. Insert the filament into the printer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Make sure the filament correctly passes through the extruder.
4. **Setting print parameters:** Set the print parameters in your printing software. This may include print speed, printer temperature, layer height, use of support structures, etc. These parameters can affect the quality and detail of the print, so it is important to set them carefully.
5. **Start printing:** After verifying everything is ready, start printing. Monitor the process during printing to identify and solve any issues on time.
6. **Completion of print and modifications:** After the print is complete, remove it from the print bed. Clean any support structures and use a pointed knife or cutting tool for fine-tuning the details of the stamp.

## Usage Instructions
The following procedure describes the usage of stamps:

1. Prepare the material into which you want to punch or emboss motifs.
2. Select a suitable stamp according to your needs.
3. Carefully place the stamp on the surface of the material.
4. For 2D stamps, use a suitable force and technique to create a clear pattern. / For 3D stamps, carefully emboss the stamp onto the material ensuring the desired motif is created.
