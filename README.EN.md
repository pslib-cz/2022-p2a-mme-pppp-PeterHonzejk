# A set of 2D/3D stamps

This project focuses on the creation of 2D and 3D stamps designed to emboss specific patterns or motifs onto various materials. These stamps are meticulously designed to accurately represent various natural and scientific elements.

These stamps offer a wide range of possibilities, whether for educational purposes, artistic endeavors, or engaging activities involving imprinting these patterns onto different materials.

## Patterns

Currently, there are four available patterns:

### Trilobite Stamp

This stamp perfectly embodies the form of a trilobite, an extinct marine arthropod that existed millions of years ago. It is ideal for educational purposes or for anyone with a fascination for prehistoric life.

## Complete Parts and Materials List

Here is a list of components and materials needed for stamp production:

- 3D printed model
- Filament for 3D printing
- Pointed knives and cutting tools
- Sandpaper

## Workflow

The following steps describe the process of creating stamps:

1. **Prepare the 3D Model:** Download the 3D stamp model from the [print files](https://github.com/pslib-cz/2022-p2a-mme-pppp-PeterHonzejk/tree/main/print%20files) folder with the .stl extension. View the model in the 3D printing software of your choice and ensure that all the details of the model are displayed correctly.

2. **Set Up the 3D Printer:** Turn on the 3D printer and check if it is properly set up. Ensure that the print bed is clean and level, and the print head is correctly aligned.

3. **Select and Prepare the Filament:** Choose filament in a suitable color. Insert the filament into the printer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Make sure the filament passes through the extruder correctly.

4. **Set Print Parameters:** In the printing software, adjust the print parameters. This may include print speed, printer temperature, layer height, the use of support structures, and more. These parameters can affect the print quality and detail, so it's important to set them carefully.

5. **Start the Print:** Once everything is prepared, start the print. Monitor the process during printing to identify and address any potential issues in a timely manner.

6. **Complete the Print and Finishing:** After the print is finished, remove the print from the print bed. Clean up any support structures and use a pointed knife or cutting tool to fine-tune the stamp's details.

## User Guide

The following steps explain how to use the stamps:

1. Prepare the material onto which you want to stamp or emboss the motifs.

2. Select the appropriate stamp based on your needs.

3. Carefully press the stamp onto the surface of the material.

4. For 2D stamps, apply sufficient pressure and technique to create a clear pattern. For 3D stamps, carefully press the stamp onto the material, ensuring the desired motif is formed.
